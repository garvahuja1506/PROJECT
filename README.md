ASSEMBLER : I applied my deep understanding and knowledge of Python and Computer Organization and made an assembler using python that converted an RISC V (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture) assembly language into it’s corresponding machine code, the way a computer or a machine executes instructions. 
•	SIMULATOR : I applied my deep understanding and knowledge of Python and Computer Organization and made a simulator using python that visualized the control flow of an RISC V (Reduced Instruction Set Architecture) assembly language instructions by keeping track of the values in the 32 general purpose registers and the program counter.
